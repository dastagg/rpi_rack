This is a document that I am using to store notes and oddities that I might want to know but can't remember.


To create the password to put in vars:
mkpasswd --method=sha-512

For Debian:

Look for PasswordAuthentication, uncomment it and make sure it is "yes"

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!

#PasswordAuthentication yes

#PermitEmptyPasswords no

PasswordAuthentication yes

You can go back and change it once the ssh is copied over.


For Ubuntu Server:

To change to static IP address:

sudo vim /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml

network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
     dhcp4: no
     addresses: [192.168.0.130/24]
     gateway4: 192.168.0.1
     nameservers:
       addresses: [192.168.0.250, 8.8.8.8]

To change the hostname:

sudo vim /etc/hostname

sudo vim /etc/cloud/cloud.cfg

Change preserve_hostname: no to preserve_hostname: yes
