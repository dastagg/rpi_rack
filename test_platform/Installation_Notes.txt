Create the Vagrant file

Debian: debian/buster64 - version = "10.0.0"
Ubuntu: hashicorp/bionic64

Launch all the VMs

 `vagrant ssh` into each one and update/upgrade to get to the lastest version


ssh into the control VM

install ansible
    sudo apt install ansible

From the Control VM, ssh into each of the VM's to add the IP address to the known-host file on the Control VM.

Create a ssh key on Control and copy to each server
    ssh-keygen  (I didn't add anything extra)
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vagrant@192.168.61.1*

For Debian:

# To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
#PasswordAuthentication yes
#PermitEmptyPasswords no

PasswordAuthentication yes

You can go back and change it once the ssh is copied over.

halt and re-launch all the VMs

Then I could run the playbooks.
