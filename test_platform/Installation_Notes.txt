Noticed the /vagrant files weren't syncing as they are "supposed" to.
exit from the VM and run "vagrant rsync" to sync up the changes.

If starting from nothing:
Create the Vagrant file

Debian: debian/buster64 - version = "10.0.0"
Ubuntu: hashicorp/bionic64

For all VM's or if one or more is destroyed
    `vagrant ssh` into each one and update/upgrade to get to the lastest version

    For all VM's except Control:
    update the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file:

        # To disable tunneled clear text passwords, change to no here!
        #PasswordAuthentication yes
        #PermitEmptyPasswords no

        Uncomment and make sure the answer is "yes" not "no"
        PasswordAuthentication yes

You can go back and change it once the ssh is copied over.



Now you can start the "Ansible Update"
--------------------------------------
ssh into the control VM

install ansible
    sudo apt install ansible

Create a ssh key on Control and copy to each server
    ssh-keygen  (I didn't add anything extra)
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub vagrant@192.168.61.1*

halt and re-launch all the VMs

Then I could run the playbooks.
