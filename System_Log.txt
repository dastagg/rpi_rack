All the Raspberry Pis are setup with the OS installed and updated.

I spent most of today creating the test_platform.
    - Created the VM using Vagrant
    - Manually update/upgrade, set the IP address and "fixed" the sshd_config to be able to connect to each server from the Controls.
    - Created and ran the init_setup playbook to create the sysop user and install some base software.
    - Used Ansible Galaxy to init four roles:
        - base
        - www
        - db
        - fossil
    - Updated the base role to use the sysop user to run a very basic task to make sure that Control will run with the sysop user instead of the vagrant user.
    - That's it for today.
