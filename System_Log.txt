Feeling good so I kept going.

Created the Fossil/Apache version of the source_control role for Test.
    - Everything is working in Test, need to copy the code to Real and see if it works.
    - Well... everything but the Ansible creation of a test repository. The manual way works fine but I just haven't figured out how to get Ansible to run the script. Maybe tomorrow.

Did a bit of clean up:
    - Made sure the inventory files matched (by name) on both systems
    - Changed "fossil" role to "source_control" as it will be both Fossil and Git.
    - Updated all the markers in the files to say source_control
    - File structure on both systems match now.

Had to run the init_setup as "ubuntu" to get it to run, then switched back to sysop and ran all the playbooks. Didn't need to do this on the test platform as all the VM's are created with the user name "vagrant" so it all "just worked". But on the real system, the Raspian user is "pi" and the Ubuntu user is "ubuntu"

So:
    - Both systems are up and running playbooks
    - Both systems are "in sync".
    - Next step is to create the source_control role and get that working.

All the Raspberry Pis are setup with the OS installed and updated.

I spent most of today creating the test_platform.
    - Created the VM using Vagrant
    - Manually update/upgrade, set the IP address and "fixed" the sshd_config to be able to connect to each server from the Controls.
    - Created and ran the init_setup playbook to create the sysop user and install some base software.
    - Used Ansible Galaxy to init four roles:
        - base
        - www
        - db
        - fossil
    - Updated the base role to use the sysop user to run a very basic task to make sure that Control will run with the sysop user instead of the vagrant user.
    - That's it for today.
