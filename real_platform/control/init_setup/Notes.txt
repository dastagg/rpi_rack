This playbook is used for the initial setup of the raspberry pis.

It installs some basic software, adds the sysop user and makes sudo NOPASSWD

Had to run the playbook as three different users

1) As "pi" to setup the Raspian based servers
2) As "ubuntu" to setup the Ubuntu based server
3) As "sysop" to make sure that the "sysop" user was created correctly.


It was run as "pi" against all the servers except test1.
    inventory but with test1 commented out
It was run as "ubuntu" against test1.
    customhost (copy of inventory but only test1)
Then ran as sysop against all.
    inventory with everyone


Some additional notes below:

Deleting a user using deluser

In order to delete a user on Debian 10, you have to use the deluser command.

$ sudo deluser <username>

To remove a user with its home directory, run the deluser command with the –remove-home parameter.

$ sudo deluser --remove-home <username>

Looking for files to backup/remove
Removing user 'user'
Warning: group 'user' has no more members.
Done.

To delete all the files associated with a user, use the –remove-all-files parameter.

$ sudo deluser --remove-all-files <username>
